# CP1404 Practicals for IT@JCU

## About This Repository
This repository contains my practical exercises and projects for CP1404/CP5632.  
I am **ManiShankar Reddy Ramapuram**, and this repository reflects my learning journey in programming, clean code practices, and software development.
## About Me
I completed my **Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)**. After graduation, I joined **Persistern Systems** as an **intern**, and later worked as a **Software Engineer**. Over time, I was promoted to **Senior Software Engineer**, gaining **3.5 years of professional experience** in areas including:  

- **Database Systems:** Informatica IICS, Snowflake, SQL Server  
- **DevOps & Scheduling:** Autosys for job scheduling, Unix scripting  
- **CRM and Platforms:** Salesforce  

During my professional journey, I realized the importance of strengthening my **programming skills**. This led me to pursue a **Master’s in Information Technology** in Australia, where I am expanding my knowledge in software development, algorithms, and programming best practices.  

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code
1. **Meaningful Naming:** Using descriptive variable, function, and class names improves readability.  
2. **Function Design (SRP):** Each function should have a single responsibility, making the code modular and easier to maintain.  
3. **Consistent Formatting & Documentation:** Proper indentation, spacing, comments, and docstrings help others (and your future self) understand the code.
