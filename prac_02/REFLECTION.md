# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

95%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch lecture videos on lecture days whenever I find some free time. I make use of the library for a quiet space to focus. After finishing each video, I typically take a 5 to 10-minute break to relax before continuing with the next one.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

So far, Iâ€™m doing well by keeping up with the weekly tasks, submitting practicals on time, and actively following the study guide to meet expectations. I will continue managing my time effectively and practicing regularly to stay on track and improve further.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I sometimes rush tasks to finish work because of other subject requirements, which leads to small mistakes. I plan to slow down, spend more time, and focus on completing each task thoroughly instead of just finishing quickly.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

At first, I struggled with using clear and meaningful variable names, which sometimes made my programs harder to understand. However, after following the guide and the lecturer videos, I have started to improve by choosing better variable names and writing proper docstrings. I will continue practicing this so my code is easier to read and maintain.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I have started learning to use Git version control to track my code, which I find interesting. The guide has made it easier for me to get used to Git and GitHub, and this has helped me manage my practical work better.
