# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I’ve started planning my practical work in smaller, manageable steps instead of doing everything at once. This approach helps me stay organised, reduce stress, and maintain better focus while completing each task efficiently.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Since it’s already halfway through the semester and most subjects now have assignments and practical submissions dues, I plan to spend more dedicated time covering all subject requirements. I need to focus on consistent study sessions during the week instead of relying on last-minute preparation. This will help me understand concepts more deeply and complete my work with better quality before the deadlines.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am consistently following the weekly materials and completing all tasks on time. I’ll keep doing this because it helps me stay confident and well-prepared for assessments.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I feel like I’m spending too much time on each task, so I need to stop overworking on small details and start managing my time better. I plan to schedule my work more carefully and compare the expected and actual time I spend on each task to stay on track and improve efficiency.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I’m really happy with how the subject is going so far. The learning materials and lecturer videos are very helpful, and I feel that I’m improving my understanding of new topics each week.
