# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Initially, my estimates were quite inconsistent. I often assumed tasks would be faster than they actually were, especially when dealing with new concepts or GUI work like Kivy layouts and dynamic widgets. Debugging unexpected behaviour also took more time than I predicted.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As I progressed, I became better at recognising how long different kinds of tasks normally take me. I started including time for reviewing my code, fixing errors, and doing proper testing. By the later practicals, my estimates were much closer to the actual time required.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of planning realistically instead of rushing. Estimating helped me slow down, break tasks into smaller steps, and schedule enough time for problem-solving, which made my workflow more organised and less stressful.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned how helpful another person’s perspective can be. Reviewers often pointed out things I had completely overlooked such as clearer variable names, better structure, or small mistakes I didn’t notice. Their feedback helped me understand that reviews aren’t negative; they’re a valuable way to improve both my code and my overall knowledge.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others’ code helped me sharpen my eye for clarity and structure. I learned how to spot repeated logic, unnecessary complexity, and style issues. It also helped me reflect on my own coding habits and apply the same standards to my work.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[PR #3 for Practical 7](https://github.com/yaner-233/cp1404practicals/pull/3)

### Explanation

In this review, I gave helpful feedback on several files. I praised the clear structure and professional formatting, suggested using with open(...) for safer file handling, and recommended standardizing input validation to avoid repeated code. I also pointed out minor consistency issues, like matching menu display with input. Overall, my goal was to give constructive advice in a clear and supportive way to improve the code’s readability and maintainability.

### Good Code Review 2

[Practical_08 Code Review](https://github.com/chidaya1903/prac_08/issues/1#issuecomment-3555121326)

### Explanation

In this review, I noticed a Git workflow issue. The changes were committed and merged directly into the main branch, so I received the code review as an issue rather than a proper pull request. This meant I couldn’t provide line-by-line feedback on the prac_08_feedback branch.

Despite this, I reviewed the code files and gave constructive feedback:

- **squaring.py –** Clean and well-structured; suggested adding docstrings to improve readability.
- **box_layout_demo.kv –** Very clear and professional layout; good use of layout properties.
- **convert_miles_km.py –** Readable and well-organised code.
- **convert_miles_km.kv –** Neat KV structure with proper use of widgets and bindings.
- **dynamic_labels.py / dynamic_labels.kv –** Works well, simple and easy-to-follow layout.    

This review helped me focus on both code quality and Git workflow best practices.
## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would like to include a few more small examples before the larger practicals that use GUI concepts like Kivy or external libraries, along with extra time for practicing with classes and Kivy programs. These guided exercises would help students build confidence before attempting the bigger tasks.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Throughout the practicals, I gradually developed cleaner and more organised coding habits. I became more confident in applying proper structure, using constants, writing tests, and choosing clear naming conventions. My ability to debug effectively, validate input, and break problems into well-defined functions grew steadily, becoming key strengths by the later practicals.
